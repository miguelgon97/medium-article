        <p style="margin-right: 60px;">
          Metallica (commonly known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica.
          It was released on August 12, 1991, by Elektra Records.
          Recording sessions took place at One on One Studios in Los Angeles over an eight-month span that frequently found Metallica at odds with their new producer Bob Rock.
          The album marked a change in the band's music from the thrash metal style of their previous four albums to a slower, heavier, and more refined sound.

            Paranoid is the second studio album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released in September 1970 through Vertigo Records in England and Warner Bros.
            The album contains several of the band's signature songs, including "Iron Man", "War Pigs" and the title track, which was the band's only Top 20 hit, reaching number 4 in the UK charts.
            In a 2017 publication by Rolling Stone magazine, Paranoid was ranked number one on its list of the "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time".
            The album is often cited a key influence for the development of the heavy metal music genre as well as one of the earliest heavy metal albums.
            Paranoid was the band's only album to top the UK Albums Chart until the release of 13 in 2013.

            The Book of Souls is the sixteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released in 4 September 2015.

            Its launch and supporting tour were delayed to allow vocalist Bruce Dickinson time to recover from the removal of a cancerous tumour in early 2015.
            It is also their first album to be released on Parlophone, since the end of their 30-year relationship with EMI Records.

        <p style="margin-right: 60px;">
          Toxicity is the second studio album by Armenian-American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001, through American Recordings and Columbia Records.
          Expanding on their 1998 eponymous debut, it incorporated more melody, harmonies, and singing than the band's first album.
          Categorized primarily as alternative metal and nu metal, Toxicity features elements of multiple genres, including folk, progressive rock, jazz, and Armenian and Greek music, including prominent use of instruments like the sitar, banjo, keyboards, and piano.
          It contains a wide array of political and non-political themes, such as mass incarceration, the CIA, the environment, police brutality, drug addiction, scientific reductionism, and groupies.
          Toxicity came out one week before September 11th, 2001. Its lead single, “Chop Suey!,” famously landed on a Clear Channel blacklist of songs to avoid broadcasting in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center.
          “Chop Suey!” contained the word “suicide,” so it joined Dave Matthews Band’s “Crash Into Me” and Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” on a roster of tracks that might conceivably remind listeners of the recent national trauma.

        <p style="margin-right: 60px;">
          Master of Puppets is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on March 3, 1986, by Elektra Records.
          Recorded in Denmark at Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming Rasmussen, it was the band's last album to feature bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident in Sweden during the album's promotional tour.
          From "Leper Messiah", and "Diposable Heroes", to "Onion" and the classic "Master of Puppets"
          this is a perfect album, sorry, a perfect METAL album, one of the greats ever,
          and certainly one to be on my list.

          The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records.
          It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rock star whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society forms a figurative wall.
          The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number three in the UK.
          It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time and one of the band's finest works.

        <p style="margin-right: 60px;">
          The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records.
          The album was primarily developed during live performances, and the band premiered an early version of the suite several months before recording began.
          The record was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and partly deal with the apparent mental health problems of former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968.
          New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.
          This is album is special for me, because it was one of the first pieces of music i remember listening in my grandpa's house in vynil.
          It's a beautiful album that has a range of songs that I identiy with. It's simply perfect and my escape to the real world.
